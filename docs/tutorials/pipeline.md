        # Pipeline

        A sequence of data transformers with an optional final predictor.

`Pipeline` allows you to sequentially apply a list of transformers to
preprocess the data and, if desired, conclude the sequence with a final
:term:`predictor` for predictive modeling.

Intermediate steps of the pipeline must be transformers, that is, they
must implement `fit` and `transform` methods.
The final :term:`estimator` only needs to implement `fit`.
The transformers in the pipeline can be cached using ``memory`` argument.

The purpose of the pipeline is to assemble several steps that can be
cross-validated together while setting different parameters. For this, it
enables setting parameters of the various steps using their names and the
parameter name separated by a `'__'`, as in the example below. A step's
estimator may be replaced entirely by setting the parameter with its name
to another estimator, or a transformer removed by setting it to
`'passthrough'` or `None`.

For an example use case of `Pipeline` combined with
:class:`~sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV`, refer to
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_compose_plot_compare_reduction.py`. The
example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_compose_plot_digits_pipe.py` shows how
to grid search on a pipeline using `'__'` as a separator in the parameter names.

Parameters
----------
steps : list of tuples
    List of (name of step, estimator) tuples that are to be chained in
    sequential order. To be compatible with the scikit-learn API, all steps
    must define `fit`. All non-last steps must also define `transform`. See
    :ref:`Combining Estimators <combining_estimators>` for more details.

transform_input : list of str, default=None
    The names of the :term:`metadata` parameters that should be transformed by the
    pipeline before passing it to the step consuming it.

    This enables transforming some input arguments to ``fit`` (other than ``X``)
    to be transformed by the steps of the pipeline up to the step which requires
    them. Requirement is defined via :ref:`metadata routing <metadata_routing>`.
    For instance, this can be used to pass a validation set through the pipeline.

    You can only set this if metadata routing is enabled, which you
    can enable using ``sklearn.set_config(enable_metadata_routing=True)``.

    .. versionadded:: 1.6

memory : str or object with the joblib.Memory interface, default=None
    Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. The last step
    will never be cached, even if it is a transformer. By default, no
    caching is performed. If a string is given, it is the path to the
    caching directory. Enabling caching triggers a clone of the transformers
    before fitting. Therefore, the transformer instance given to the
    pipeline cannot be inspected directly. Use the attribute ``named_steps``
    or ``steps`` to inspect estimators within the pipeline. Caching the
    transformers is advantageous when fitting is time consuming. See
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_neighbors_plot_caching_nearest_neighbors.py`
    for an example on how to enable caching.

verbose : bool, default=False
    If True, the time elapsed while fitting each step will be printed as it
    is completed.

Attributes
----------
named_steps : :class:`~sklearn.utils.Bunch`
    Dictionary-like object, with the following attributes.
    Read-only attribute to access any step parameter by user given name.
    Keys are step names and values are steps parameters.

classes_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
    The classes labels. Only exist if the last step of the pipeline is a
    classifier.

n_features_in_ : int
    Number of features seen during :term:`fit`. Only defined if the
    underlying first estimator in `steps` exposes such an attribute
    when fit.

    .. versionadded:: 0.24

feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
    Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Only defined if the
    underlying estimator exposes such an attribute when fit.

    .. versionadded:: 1.0

>>> pipe = Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()), ('svc', SVC())])
>>> # The pipeline can be used as any other estimator
>>> # and avoids leaking the test set into the train set
>>> pipe.fit(X_train, y_train).score(X_test, y_test)
